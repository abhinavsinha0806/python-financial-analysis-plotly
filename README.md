This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of major US bank stocks from 2006 to 2016, focusing on their performance through the 2008 financial crisis. The analysis leverages modern Python libraries to fetch, clean, and visualize financial time-series data.

The primary goal is to demonstrate a modern data analysis workflow, moving from basic data inspection to creating insightful, fully interactive visualizations with Plotly.

Key Analyses Include:

Time-Series Analysis: Plotting Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices over time.

Volatility and Risk Assessment: Calculating daily percentage returns and using standard deviation to identify the riskiest stocks.

Correlation Analysis: Creating interactive heatmaps to visualize how different bank stocks move in relation to each other.

Technical Analysis: Implementing and plotting common technical indicators like Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Bollinger Bands.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation, time-series analysis, and calculations.

yfinance: For fetching historical stock market data.

Plotly: For creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations (line charts, heatmaps, and technical studies).

Jupyter Notebook: As the development environment.

This repository serves as a practical example for anyone looking to apply Python skills to financial data analysis and create compelling, interactive dashboards.
