This project is an exploratory analysis of the stock prices of four major US banks: Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The analysis covers the period from the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis through to early 2025, providing insights into their performance and recovery over two decades. This Jupyter Notebook is for educational purposes to demonstrate skills in data acquisition, analysis, and visualization using Python.

Key Features:

Data Acquisition: Fetches historical stock data using the yfinance library.

Data Manipulation: Utilizes pandas and numpy for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigates key metrics like open, close, high, and low prices, and calculates daily returns.

Data Visualization: Employs plotly to create interactive visualizations, including a scatter matrix to compare the daily returns of the different bank stocks.
